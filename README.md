# SQL PROJECT

## Overview

This project is based on the **Chinook sample database**, a relational database representing a digital media store.  
It includes data about artists, albums, tracks, playlists, customers, employees, and invoices.

The database was created using **MySQL**. The schema was explored and SQL queries were written using **DataGrip**, and later continued in **Visual Studio Code**.

## Tasks Performed
Performed general data exploration and validation checks on the Music Store.

Wrote SQL queries to analyze total revenue by country, top genres in USA, top artist vs tracks, sales effectiveness of employees, customers vs revenue.
